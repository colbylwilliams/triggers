# triggers

A test repository for workflow failed triggers — specifically testing the pattern where a CI workflow fails and a Copilot agent is automatically triggered to analyze and fix the failure.

## Workflows

| Workflow | File | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Check Code Comments** | `.github/workflows/check-comments.yaml` | Scans source files for `// BROKEN`, `// FIXME`, `// HACK` comments and fails if any are found |
| **Build** | `.github/workflows/build.yaml` | Runs `npm ci` and `tsc` in the `app/` directory; fails on TypeScript compilation errors |

## Agents

| Agent | File | Trigger |
|-------|------|---------|
| **CI Repair** | `.github/agents/fix-ci.md` | `workflow_run: failed` on Check Code Comments and Build workflows |
| **Triager** | `.github/agents/triager.md` | `issues: opened` |
| **Joker** | `.github/agents/joker.md` | `interval: daily` |
| **Weekly Update** | `.github/agents/weekly-update.md` | `interval: weekly` |

## How to trigger a workflow failure

### Method 1: Forbidden comment (easiest)

Add a forbidden comment to any `.ts` or `.js` file and push:

```typescript
// HACK this needs to be refactored
```

The **Check Code Comments** workflow will detect it and fail, triggering the CI Repair agent.

### Method 2: TypeScript compilation error

Introduce a type error in `app/src/index.ts` and push:

```typescript
const port: number = "not a number"; // type error
```

The **Build** workflow will fail on `tsc`, triggering the CI Repair agent.

### Method 3: Manual dispatch

Both workflows support `workflow_dispatch` — trigger them manually from the Actions tab.
